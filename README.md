## Description
This is Junying Li's solution for assignment 1. It contains 6 kinds of graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, ellipses, polylines) in different colors and some of them have stroking. Each of these primitives is drawn on the left top as an example. By using these graphics primitives, I designed a beautiful Christmas tree in snow. There's a snow animation and shiny lights decorated on the Christmas tree. Also, user can play background music by clicking the play music button and pause it by clicking pause music button. In addition, when mouseover bulbs(circles) on the Christmas tree, someone will say Merry Christmas to user (autometically play audio). Audios need some time to load, please wait for a sec if the audio cannot be played.

Here are two screenshots of my page.

## Section for Technical and Design Achievements
### Technical achievements
1. It contains 6 kinds of graphics primitives in defferent colors.
2. Snow animation and shiny light animation using transition.
3. Play audio by `play()` method.
### Design achievements
1. Draw a Christmas tree by using basic graphics primitives.
2. The snow animation can help us release stress.
3. Users can listen to Christmas music.
4. When mouseover bulbs(circles) on Christmas tree, it will autometically play voice audio of Merry Christmas from woman, little boy, Santa Claus and The Jackson 5.
