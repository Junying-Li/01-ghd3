## Description
This is Junying Li's solution for assignment 1. It contains 6 kinds of graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, ellipses, polylines) in different colors and some of them have stroking. Each of these primitives is drawn on the left top as an example. By using these graphics primitives, I designed a Christmas tree. Users can light up the bulbs on this tree by mouseover them. There will be a blur effect to stimulate light when mouseover. Here are two screenshots of my page.
