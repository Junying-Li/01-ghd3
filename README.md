## Description
This is Junying Li's solution for assignment 1. It contains 6 kinds of graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, ellipses, polylines) in different colors and some of them have stroking. Each of these primitives is drawn on the left top as an example. By using these graphics primitives, I designed a beautiful Christmas tree in snow. There's a snow animation and shiny lights decorated on the Christmas tree. Also, user can play background music by clicking the play music button and pause it by clicking pause music button. Here is the screenshot of my page.
